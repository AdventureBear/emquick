## EM Quick
This is a resource to quickly look up reference information for emergency medicine students, residents, attendings, PA-C & NPs while working in the ER. 

The developers and contributors make no guarantees and take no responsibility for the accuracy of this information.  References are provided for every resource, but there is always the possibiliyt of typos or database errors. 

THis is for reference only. The practitioner is responsible for making sure the information they use to care for patients is accurate and uptodate. 


## Getting started

    npm install
    npm run server //runs node server on port 3001 (or PORT set in .env)
    npm run client //runs react client on port 3000
    npm run dev //starts both servers :) 

## Inspiration

Browse the halls of any medical school or hospital floor and you'll see students and residents whose pockets are jam packed full of pocket-sized reference books. As training progresses they are lulled into thinking that they have key bits of knowledge committed to memory, yet medical recommendations are constantly changing.  

As an example the use of Vasopressin in cardiac arrest as gone in and out of favor with changes in the official Americal Heart Association guidelines every couple of years since the early 2000s. If you're actively training, you may have learned the most current recommendation, but if you've been out of training for awhile, it's possible the removal of vasopression may have slipped past you. 

Alternatively other information remains mostly static such as the number of teeth in the maxilla and mandible or the distribution of senosory and motor nerves. 

Finally, today's practitioner has to keep in mind a multitude of 'calculators' and scores such as PERC, HEART, NIH, Well's Criteria (for DVT & for PE) and the list goes on and on.  ABCD2, CHADS, Sepsis, etc etc.  There are several excellent websites for calculator use such as MDCalc.com started by Graham Walker, MD when he was a medical student, however, EM Quick combines both common EM calculators as well as static and dynamically changing reference information for those actively caring for patients. 

I made this for my own use and wish to share it with others.  I hope you find it helpful. 

## Contributions
Contributions to development of the app are warmly welcomed, as are contributions to the database of resources, which I"ll be adding to a little at a time.

## Developers Background
### TL;DR
I've started programming when I was 12, and 37 years later, can finally create a full stack project that started in my imagination. 

### The details
I wrote my first computer program in 1980, I programmed on TRS-80s both with no memory, as well as tape drives.  I remember the Apple ][e computer as a fun after school enrichment toy.  I continued to dabble in programming for many years and have used many different languages, starting with Pascal, and then moving to assembly language (I loved the challenge) and Basic.  My geeky friends and I programmed a moon lander game that was disqualified at a annual county programming competition because it was so smooth the judges assumed we had cheated (we had not...we worked on it really hard).  I finally won a programming competition as a  14 year old having programmed a maze generator in basic.  

Prior to medical school,  as a 28 year old self taught database programmer,  I got a job as a database analyst working directly with the president of a local medical software company.  When I left for school he had never realized I'd not had a job programming prior to that. I learned a lot in that year about databases and have see many aspects of life and living as easily solvable database applications.  

In 1998 I programmed my first medical calculator app on an early generation Palm Pilot.   The software for programming the device was clunky poorly documented.  I became fascinated with portable technology applications and possibilities, and started distributing CDs containing various Palm Pilot apps under the company name of Bartonella Software.  My CDs were ordered by several medical school education directors who encouraged me to continue in my exploration of  the intersection of medical educaiton and technology. 

As a 4th year medical student, myself along with one other classmate, co-develeped the first web-based dermatology course at the University of Pittsburgh along with the course director Douglas Kress, MD, and our staff programmer, ***.    As a result of this, David and I were asked to make a presentation on our course at the an annual conference for the medical education committee, in charge of determining the curriculum for the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. I spoke of the potential future of medical education and the web -- it was a new, exciting development at the time.  As before I was encouraged by faculty mentors to continue on this path of interest and to hone my public speaking skills for future presentations. 

During my residency, I unfortunately needed back surgery, which ironically occured during my orthopedics  rotation.  I was able ot make up the ortho clincs over the next year, and was able to use my month of recovery at home to again teach myself some programming...this time PHP/MySQL.  I created a birding website, in which a birdwatcher could create an account, and log birding outings, tracking the birds they had seen , and keeping life lists.  Every species of bird in the world was available in that app.  At the time, there was only one other birding resource online (eBird, which remains a great birding site). 

Fast forward to the 2010s when I decided to once again revisit web based development.  Using Free Code Camp as my guide, I began learning about javascript and non-relational databases (wow...talk about a paradigm change).  I was able to contribute several curriculum examples and a "bootcamp cost calculator" to Free Code Camp and in this way was able to help educate learners from all over the world with my projects, and once again found a mentor, the foudner of Free Code Camp, Quincy Larson, who encouraged me to complete projects I doubted I could do.
